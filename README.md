# sv_characterization
The sequence characterization of structural variants is still an open problem, espe- cially for very long repetitive insertions. In this thesis, we proposed the approach for complete genome sequence characterization for insertional structural variants in human genomes. Our method is based on collecting discordant, concordant and split- reads from all publicly available human genome data that cover breakpoints and an insertion. These reads are validated based on quality filters and patterns. Then, they are assembled into contigs using local de novo sequence assembly, and the contigs are merged from both sides of the insertion until they overlap. The information about a particular MEI is extracted from the alignment to the consensus, and TSD is de- duced. In case of a successful characterization, the full insertion sequence is reported, otherwise, at least the breakpoint sequences are obtained.
